# Comparison Operators: Comparison operator is use to compare two values and based on that it will return result in boolean.

a = 5

ans2 = (a != b) # Here we are comparing whether a & b are not equal. If they are not equal it will return True boolean as a result otheriwse False.

ans3 = (a > b) # Here we are comparing whether a is greater than b. If a is greater than b it will return True boolean as a result otheriwse False.

ans4 = (a < b) # Here we are comparing whether a is lesser than b. If a is lesser than b it will return True boolean as a result otheriwse False.

ans5 = (a >= b) # Here we are comparing whether a is greater than or equal to b. If a is greater than or equal to b it will return True boolean as a result otheriwse False.

ans6 = (a <= b) # Here we are comparing whether a is lesser than or equal to b. If a is lesser than or equal b it will return True boolean as a result otheriwse False.
