# Logical Operators: In Python, Logical operators operate on conditional statements.

# and -> True if both operands are True else False.
# or  -> True if at least one operand is True else False.
# not -> Inverts True to False and False to True.

a = 10
b = 8
c = 6

# and Logical Operator:
if (a>b) and (b>c):
    print("True!")

# or Logical Operator:
if (a>b) or (b>c):
    print("True!")

# and Logical Operator:
if (not False):
    print("True!")
